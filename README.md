# Local storage Size

This is a simple script that uses binary search to determine the size of local storage in a browser. Unlike other scripts it tells you *exactly* how many characters you can store and due to the binary search it does so fairly quickly.

Simply open the [github page](https://gurbindersingh.github.io/localstorage-size/) and click on `Start test`.
